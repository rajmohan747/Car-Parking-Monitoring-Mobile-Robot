With constant increase of vehicle agglomeration worldwide,car parking is one of the major concerns in terms of space occupation in 
densely populated cities.cities.Though Multi Level Car Parking (MLCP) system provides a relief for this issue,looking for empty parking
spaces and retrieving parked in congested parking spaces can be painstaking and time consuming.

As a cost effective solution, a four wheel driven MLCP assisting mobile robot was proposed.The robot will be moving across the entire 
parking area monitoring the vehicles parked in the MLCP and corresponding parking slot.Sensor fusion techniques were implemented 
minimizing the human intervention in the robot motion.Camera mounted on top of the mobile robot collects the images of registration number
plates of the vehicles parked in the MLCP.The entire set of information collected will be updated into the cloud data base.Image processingtechniques were used for extracting information from these images.Operation of the robot as well as the camera can be controlled using an android tablet. Information collected can be used for monitoringwhether vehicles are parked in allocated slot itself.


Use the image files attached for creating the circuitry for the basic mobile robot.
